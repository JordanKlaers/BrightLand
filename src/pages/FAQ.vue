        <h2>Do I buy or rent the lights?</h2>

          work no matter how wet Washington gets. All lighting material is custom made to fit your

        <h2>What happens to the lights if I move?</h2>
        <p>
          We call this a 'Zombie job', If you move the lights are still yours, but we can recut and
          rearrange the old display to fit your new home and new needs. If there are left over
          lights, we'll work with you in your new home so see where else we can utilize every last
          bulb!

        <h2>What effects the cost of instillation?</h2>
        <p>
          We sell the materials for $3.50 per foot of roofline lighting, and $25 per ball of light
          (24' string lighting typically used for wrapping pillars/rails and trees/bushes). You can
          schedule a free quote, and one of our lights technicians will walk you through a breakdown
          of costs once we see overall lengths and ease of access for your lighting needs
